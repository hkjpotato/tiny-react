# What it is trying to do?

Starting from the root problem: UI tree updating, let's assume we are the react creator, and try to solve the problem from scratch/reverse engineering.
Can we come up with a solution somehow similar to the current React source code? --- see update below


## Update on the end of 2021
I do not have time to polish the code this year, as I was dragged to some backend stuffs. You can still get hints from the early commits messages, on what fiber is, why using linklist and why recursion should be avoided.

I do want to share something interesting I learn, from the discussion with other open source contributors.

Today, React is not just a UI framework. Perhaps, the most important and challenging task is not about commiting data to the doms, but to find a smart and efficient way to __calculate a diff in the output, based on a diff in the input__.

If you look React from the way to it computes the diff, it does share some similarities with a build system like typescript compiler: as they both need to do one job: __incremental computation__.
