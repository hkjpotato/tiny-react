# What it is trying to do?

Starting from the root problem: UI tree updating, let's assume we are the react creator, and try to solve the problem from scratch/reverse engineering.
Can we come up with a solution somehow similar to the current React source code?


# update on the end of 2021
I do not have time to polish the code this year, was dragged to some backend stuffs. I will find some time next year.

I do want to share something interesting I learned, from the discussion within other open source contributors, TC39 member, and actually from some designs of AWS backend system :) 

React is not just a UI library. Actually, the most important/challenging task is not to commiting to dom, but to find a smart and efficient way to calculate a diff in output, based on a diff input in another domain.

If you look React from the way to it computes the diff, it does share some similarities with a build system like typescript compiler: as they both need to do one job, which is "incremental computation".
